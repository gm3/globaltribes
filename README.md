## Why did we create it?

Our creative lab, founded by Tom Laroc, was created to foster collaborations among creative professionals from various fields, to establish our digital hub, and digital main street.

Over the last 2 years, our network has connected the dots across various industries. We help, organize, find alignment between people, projects, potential opportunities, build, raise funding, and complete projects with our team.

## How we like to work

Our working group operates in an open and transparent nature, publishing our research for years now, and frequently host rooms to foster our goals and the overall mission, to do our best work. We hold each other accountable for documentation, so that we can capture value aligned opportunities, by engineering win-win solutions in a practical and achievable way.

## How you can help

We meet up in Jitsi in the writers room to share ideas and culture. We would love to have you come by and introduce yourself! We also have a Discord and GitHub you can follow, check out the current bounties that are available! [Contact us](https://globaltribes.art/contact)

## Sponsorship / Grants / Support Our Research

We are actively looking for sponsorships, grants, and funding to enable us to scale.
